## Cyndx React Challenge

Your challenge is to complete building this single page application, a dog breed image viewer, using the React framework. When the application is complete, it will meet the following criteria:

- The application should display a list of dog breeds displaying 10 results at a time. If the breed is a family of sub breeds, there will be an item in the list for each sub breed.

- There should be pagination controls that will display to the user the current page of results, the total number of pages of results, and previous/next buttons to change the current page of results.

- The user will be able to click on the name of a dog breed in the list and view a random picture of that dog breed. There will be a button to fetch another random image of the breed.

- The user interface will be customized so that the primary color is #4a90e2 and the secondary color is #e2844a.

- Code should be written and optimized to the best of your ability.
